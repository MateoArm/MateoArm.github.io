Hi my name is Mateo Armijo. I am currently a second year undergradaute at Occidental College in Los Angeles where I study mathematics and economics. My intrests lie in financial mathematics and I am currently reading J Robert Buchanan's book on that topic. I am a TA for Professor Sundberg's Honors Calculus one course and a director of Occidental's student run hedge fund. Outside of learning I also enjoy biking, reading manga and anime, and cooking.
