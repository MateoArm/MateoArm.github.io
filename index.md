# Welcome

Im Mateo Armijo, an undergraduate at Occidental College studying Economics and Mathematics.

As of Fall 2025 I am taking Discrete Math, Real Analysis I and Microeconomics.

Here I try to add my class notes, some are already uploaded. I started typing up my notes for revision purposes late spring of 2025. I will try my best to retroactively upload the notes from prior courses.
